## Hello everyone !
This is a blog  of a very opinionated geek, namely [me](www.minhaj.me). Although I may write about anything that strikes my fancy or my browser, but I have a few common topics which you can recognise by the tags. I am a proud geek, profound gamer, programmer by trade, and I tend to have rather logical opinions which I keep preserved in my mind palace unless required.

For those of you who are interested in some personal facts, I am a 4th year college student enrolled in Computer Science stream of B.Tech. I got interested in web developing and designing after the Industrial training programme which I took during my summer break after first year of college. Then there's no stopping me from fulfilling my insatiable lust for knowledge.

As a programmer, my language of choice(at present) are PHP and Python. I have dabbled in java in 10th grade and I know C++ a little, but when when it comes to actually implementing algos there's nothing better than C for me. Obviously, I also know a thing or two about HTML, CSS, and all that jazz â€“ after all, I did industrial training in it and I do run this blog!
