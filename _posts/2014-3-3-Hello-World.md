Think and answer. Have you not really had that moment where you stopped from your busy and profoundly confusing life and thought "What is the meaning of all this? Why am I doing it? Why am I doing this job and not trying something new? Why did I make those choices back when I was a child? What am I trying to prove by doing all this? Whom am I trying to prove it to! " It is at this moment that you can do yourself a favour and remember the words of LIFE's motto from the movie - The Secret Life of Walter Mitty: "To see the world, things dangerous to come to, to see behind walls, draw closer, to find each other, and to feel. That is the purpose of life."

While we all run for the rat race, there are few odd ones who tread their own path and create their footprints on the sands of time and create yet another type of race for others to follow. We all want to be the answer to the question "Select the odd one out." and we forget that we all are the right answer for our own self if only we can remember to be our true identity. What is our true self you ask! It can be said as the amalgamated mixture of the experiences of your life.

So the quintessence of life is discovering our true self, either by conscious choices that we make, or by the unplanned events that occur in our life and define us.
